# hello_world
my first GitHub repository

My pronouns are (he/him).

I am an upper division physics/math student at Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR USA.

I am a relatively new programmer, and am working on fundamental concepts of programming to aid my
investigations and studies in math and science. 

My computational work is mainly in python, though I have also used some mathematica and some MATLAB.
